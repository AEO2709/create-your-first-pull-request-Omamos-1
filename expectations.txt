My expectations for my journey in CMSC 100 is that I will be 
able to learn or atleast get a gist of how to create a 
program/product as a whole starting from the design process 
upto managing the different components of the program such as 
front-end, back-end, and database section.

     I would say your expectations are holistic and I too would
     love to acquire skills about the design process in web development.
     Overall, I hope you enjoy this course and I look forward working
     with you in the future.
